# ImplicitGraphs

An `ImplicitGraph` is a graph in which the vertices and edges are implicitly defined by two functions: one that tests for vertex membership and one that returns a list of the (out) neighbors of a vertex. 

The vertex set of an `ImplicitGraph` may be finite or (implicitly) infinite. The (out) degrees, however, must be finite.

## Creating Graphs


An `ImplicitGraph` is defined as follows:
```
ImplicitGraph{T}(has_vertex, out_neighbors)
```
where 
* `T` is the data type of the vertices.
* `has_vertex(v::T)::Bool` is a function that takes objects of type `T` as input and returns `true` if `v` is a vertex of the graph.
* `out_neighbors(v::T)::Vector{T}` is a function that takes objects of type `T` as input and returns a list of the (out) neighbors of `v`.

For example, the following creates an (essentially) infinite path whose vertices are integers (see the `iPath` function):
```
yes(v::Int)::Bool = true 
N(v::Int)::Vector{Int} = [v-1, v+1]
G = ImplicitGraph{Int}(yes, N)
```
The `yes` function always returns `true` for any `Int`. The `N` function returns the two neighbors of a vertex `v`. (For a truly infinite path, use `BigInt` in place of `Int`.)

Note that if `v` is an element of its own neighbor set, that represents a loop at vertex `v`.

### Undirected and directed graphs 

The user-supplied `out_neighbors` function can be used to create both undirected and directed graphs. If an undirected graph is intended, be sure that if `{v,w}` is an edge of the graph, then `w` will be in the list returned by `out_neighbors(v)` and `v` will be in the list returned by `out_neighbors(w)`.

To create an infinite *directed* path, the earlier example can be modified like this:
```
yes(v::Int)::Bool = true 
N(v::Int)::Vector{Int} = [v+1]
G = ImplicitGraph{Int}(yes, N)
```


## Predefined Graphs

We provide a few basic graphs that can be created using the following methods:

* `iCycle(n::Int)` creates an undirected cycle with vertex set `{1,2,...,n}`; 
`iCycle(n,false)` creates a directed `n`-cycle.

* `iPath()` creates an (essentially) infinite undirected path whose vertex set contains all integers (objects of type `Int`);
`iPath(false)` creates a one-way infinite path `⋯ → -2 → -1 → 0 → 1 → 2 → ⋯`.

* `iGrid()` creates an (essentially) infinite grid whose vertices are ordered pairs of integers (objects of type `Int`).

* `iCube(d::Int)` creates a `d`-dimensional cube graph. The vertices are all `d`-long strings of `0`s and `1`s. Two vertices are adjacent iff they differ in exactly one bit.

* `iKnight()` creates the Knight's move graph on an (essentially) infinite chessboard. The vertices are pairs of integers (objects of type `Int`).

* `iShift(alphabet, n::Int)` creates the shift digraph whose vertices are `n`-tuples of elements of `alphabet`.


## Inspection

* To test if `v` is a vertex of an `ImplicitGraph` `G`, use `has(G)`. Note that the data type of `v` must match the element type of `G`. (The function `eltype` returns the data type of the vertices of the `ImplicitGraph`.)

* To test if `{v,w}` is an edge of `G` use `G[v,w]` or `has(G,v,w)`. Note that `v` and `w` must both be vertices of `G` or an error is thrown.

* To get a list of the (out) neighbors of a vertex `v`, use `G[v]`.

* To get the degree of a vertex in a graph, use `deg(G,v)`.

```
julia> G = iGrid()
ImplicitGraph{Tuple{Int64,Int64}}

julia> has_vertex(G,(1,2))
true

julia> G[(1,2)]
4-element Array{Tuple{Int64,Int64},1}:
 (1, 1)
 (1, 3)
 (0, 2)
 (2, 2)

julia> G[(1,2),(1,3)]
true

julia> deg(G,(5,0))
4
```

## Path Finding

### Shortest path

The function `find_path` finds a shortest path between vertices of a graph. This function may run without returning if the graph is infinite and disconnected.
```
julia> G = iGrid()
ImplicitGraph{Tuple{Int64, Int64}}

julia> find_path(G, (0, 0), (3, 5))
9-element Array{Tuple{Int64, Int64}, 1}:
 (0, 0)
 (0, 1)
 (0, 2)
 (0, 3)
 (0, 4)
 (0, 5)
 (1, 5)
 (2, 5)
 (3, 5)
```

The function `dist` returns the length of a shortest path between vertices in the graph.
```
julia> dist(G, (0, 0), (3, 5))
8
```

For large undirected graphs, you may find that `find_path_undirected` runs faster.
It uses bidirectional search to reduce memory usage and runtime. It does not support
directed graphs, however.

#### Option: abstract target vertices

Optionally, instead of a single target vertex whose type is the same as other vertices of the `ImplicitGraph`, we can call `find_path` with this signature:
```
find_path(G::ImplicitGraph{T}, s::T, is_target::Function) where {T}
```
The function `is_target` is expected to take a vertex of `G` as its only argument and return a `Bool` which is `true` if the vertex is a target. In this way, we can search for a path from the source vertex to one of many target vertices, or a vertex with a specified property.

#### Option: cutoff depth

Path finding can consume an amout of memory that is exponential in the length of the path, which can crash Julia. To avoid this, we can call `find_path` with this signature:
```
find_path(G::ImplicitGraph{T}, s::T, t::T, cutoff_depth::Int=0) where {T}
```
Paths with length at most `cutoff_depth` will be found, but attempting to find a longer path results in an empty output (as if the path did not exist):
```
julia> G = iGrid()
ImplicitGraph{Tuple{Int64,Int64}}

julia> find_path(G, (0, 0), (3, 5), 8)
9-element Array{Tuple{Int64 ,Int64}, 1}:
 (0, 0)
 (0, 1)
 (0, 2)
 (0, 3)
 (0, 4)
 (0, 5)
 (1, 5)
 (2, 5)
 (3, 5)

julia> IG.find_path(G, (0, 0), (3, 5), 7)
Tuple{Int64, Int64}[]
```

> **Note**: Setting `cutoff_depth` to `0` allows a search for paths of unlimited length; only
positive values limit the length. 

### Guided path finding

The function `guided_path_finder` employs a score function to try to find a 
path between vertices. It may be faster than `find_path`, but might not give a shortest path.

This function is called as follows: `guided_path_finder(G,s,t,score=sc, depth=d, verbose=0)` where
* `G` is an `ImplicitGraph`,
* `s` is the starting vertex of the desired path,
* `t` is the ending vertex of the desired path,
* `sc` is a score function that mapping vertices to integers and should get smaller as vertices get closer to `t` (and should minimize at `t`), 
* `d` controls amount of look ahead (default is `1`), and 
* `verbose` sets how often to print progess information (or `0` for no diagnostics).

```
julia> G = iKnight();

julia> s = (9,9); t = (0,0);

julia> sc(v) = sum(abs.(v));  # score of (a,b) is |a| + |b|

julia> guided_path_finder(G,s,t,score=sc,depth=1)
9-element Vector{Tuple{Int64, Int64}}:
 (9, 9)
 (8, 7)
 (7, 5)
 (6, 3)
 (5, 1)
 (3, 0)
 (1, -1)
 (-1, -2)
 (0, 0)

# With better look-ahead we find a shorter path

julia> guided_path_finder(G,s,t,score=sc,depth=3)
7-element Vector{Tuple{Int64, Int64}}:
 (9, 9)
 (8, 7)
 (7, 5)
 (6, 3)
 (4, 2)
 (2, 1)
 (0, 0)
```
Greater depth can find a shorter path, but that comes at a cost:
```
julia> using BenchmarkTools

julia> @btime guided_path_finder(G,s,t,score=sc,depth=1);
  52.361 μs (1308 allocations: 81.05 KiB)

julia> @btime guided_path_finder(G,s,t,score=sc,depth=3);
  407.546 μs (8691 allocations: 696.47 KiB)
```
